OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec (both 2.0 and 3.0 are supported). Please see [OpenAPITools/openapi-generator]

This project checks the [maven repository] once a day for a new version and will publish this new version automatically as a python package.

## Installation

You must have the `java` binary executable available on your PATH for this to work. (JDK 11 is the minimal version supported. To install OpenJDK, please visit <https://adoptium.net/>)

You can install the package either in a virtual environment or globally.

```sh
# install the latest version of "openapi-generator-cli"
pip install openapi-generator-cli

```

After installation `openapi-generator-cli` command will be available in your virtual environment or globally depending on your installation.
